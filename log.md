# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on code wars problems today. I completed some fixes to [Emilys Eccentric Encoding](https://www.codewars.com/kata/emilys-eccentric-encoding) and also created [Frame a phrase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rithm-series-frame-a-phrase-simple).  I'm working on a more advanced phrase framer.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get started and hopeful that my problems will become useful on codewars.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent today working on a react app that I'll eventually use for a workshop I'm giving in a few months.  

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on a react app for a workshop.

**Thoughts:** It was tough to get my hour in tonight. I spent the day at work, then doing a beginner's python class for pyladies and then did some errands when I got home.  I'm happy with the progress that I made though considering I started coding after 11pm.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More react to prepare for the workshop in March.  Still thinking about which component should own state for this demo.

**Thoughts**: Another late start tonight.  I'm looking forward to the weekend to get my coding in early.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017


**Today's Progress**: More react for presentations in March.  Also did some codewar's problems for C.

**Thoughts**: I realize how much I have forgotten about C.  I'm really rusty.  I'm planning to do more so that I don't completely forget how to manage memory.

**Links**: Codewars problems I finished were [String Left Strip](https://www.codewars.com/kata/strings-string-left-strip/c) and [String ends with](https://www.codewars.com/kata/strings-ends-with/c)
