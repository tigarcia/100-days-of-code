# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on code wars problems today. I completed some fixes to [Emilys Eccentric Encoding](https://www.codewars.com/kata/emilys-eccentric-encoding) and also created [Frame a phrase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rithm-series-frame-a-phrase-simple).  I'm working on a more advanced phrase framer.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get started and hopeful that my problems will become useful on codewars.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent today working on a react app that I'll eventually use for a workshop I'm giving in a few months.  

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on a react app for a workshop.

**Thoughts:** It was tough to get my hour in tonight. I spent the day at work, then doing a beginner's python class for pyladies and then did some errands when I got home.  I'm happy with the progress that I made though considering I started coding after 11pm.
