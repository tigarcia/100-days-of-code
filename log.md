# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on code wars problems today. I completed some fixes to [Emilys Eccentric Encoding](https://www.codewars.com/kata/emilys-eccentric-encoding) and also created [Frame a phrase](https://www.codewars.com/kata/rithm-series-frame-a-phrase-simple).  I'm working on a more advanced phrase framer.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get started and hopeful that my problems will become useful on codewars.
